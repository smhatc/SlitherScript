## 🔍 Background Information
I am creating this project as part of my studies at General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp.

The reason I chose to create a snake game as my project is simply because I found the idea to be incredibly fun and intriguing for a beginner's game project, while at the same time allowing for the oppurtunity to learn much of JavaScript's fundamentals along with CSS Grid which I believe will be valuable knowledge for me in the future.
